For the first chapter of this project, **The Daily Derja** was all about Tunisian Arabic.  
That made sense: I was heading toward Djerba, had Tunisian friends, and “Derja” felt like the right flag to plant.

Since that trip, my reality is back in Israel. Most of the Arabic I hear around me is **Levantine / Shami**, not Tunisian.  
If I want my daily Arabic writing to connect to the people I actually meet on buses and in cafés, Shami has to move to the front of the stage.

So here’s the new deal:

- New diary posts will be **in Shami** (with the usual mix of complaining, reflections, and random musings).
- The Tunisian posts stay online as an **archive**, not a mistake.
- I’ll probably still borrow Tunisian words or habits sometimes. Languages don’t respect clean borders and neither do I.

If you’ve been following along for the Tunisian phase: thank you, that chapter is still part of the story.  
From here on out, though, we’re shifting the camera northeast.
