## What Is نسمة شامية?

Daily Derja started as a Tunisian Arabic practice blog. Life pulled me northward, so it became **نسمة شامية**—a Shami breeze through my day, one small post at a time.

I’m learning Levantine Arabic as an adult—slow and steady, fitting practice around family and work. Most days I publish something small: a photo, a sentence, a word, a moment, or a note about whatever is shifting in life.

You’ll still see some Tunisian notes and old posts here. That’s part of my path and I’m keeping the archive.

I keep posts small on purpose—unpolished, practical, and focused on consistency over polish.

The project is organized into simple series (a few examples):

- <span dir="rtl">نسمة نهار</span> — daily reflections
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة كلمة</span> — vocab bites
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة صورة</span> — one photo, quick caption
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة نغمة</span> — what I’m listening to
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة معنى</span> — small cultural/meaning notes
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة قصة</span> — short stories from family life

Browse all the series: [Series](/series/).

If you’re learning Arabic too—especially Levantine—you might find something useful. If not, it’s still a daily journal with photos, family notes, and plenty of coffee.

This is my space to keep moving, keep learning, and breathe a little every day. Slowly, slowly — شوي شوي — نسمة بنسمة.

## Who Am I?

I’m Jacob Shore. I’m in tech, and Daily Derja is where I practice Shami Arabic in public, slowly and without ceremony. It’s a small discipline that survives even on the chaotic days. I live in Israel with my wife and our five boys.
