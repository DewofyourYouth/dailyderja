## What Is نسمة شامية?

Daily Derja started as a Tunisian Arabic practice blog.
Over time, life pulled me northward — and now the project has become
نسمة شامية: a Shami breeze moving through my day, one small post at a time.

I’m learning Levantine Arabic as an adult, slowly and steadily, without perfectionism and without drama. Most days I write something short: a photo, a sentence, a word I learned, a little moment, a few lines about the things that are changing in my life.

You’ll see a bit of Tunisian still floating around here — some notes, old posts, and an archive of vocabulary. That’s part of the story too.

I keep the posts small on purpose.
Not polished. Not academic. Just daily touches of Arabic as I try to build real language flow and stay consistent.

The project is divided into simple series:

- <span dir="rtl">نسمة صورة</span> — a photo and a short caption  
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة كلمة</span> — a word I’m learning  
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة لحظة</span> — a small moment from the day  
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة سَمعة</span> — something I’m listening to  
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة ناس</span> — conversations or lines I hear from people around me  
- <span dir="rtl">نسمة كتابة</span> — practice writing  


If you’re learning Arabic too — especially Levantine — maybe you’ll find something useful here.
And if not, at least there’s always good coffee in the background.

This is my space to keep moving, keep learning, and breathe a little every day.
Slowly, slowly — شوي شوي — نسمة بنسمة.

## Who Am I?

I’m Jacob Shore — married, father of five, living in Israel. I work in tech, think too much, drink a lot of coffee, and write small daily posts as I try to learn Shami Arabic without getting swallowed by the rest of life.
