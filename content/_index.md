title: Daily Derja
---

Since the beginning of Operation Rising Lion I’ve decided to start a daily reflection series on Derja, Tunisian Arabic. The goal of this reflection is to improve my understanding of Derja by writing a daily reflection in Arabic as well as making a short video explaining the reflection.

_Note:_ After Operation Rising Lion completed and I was able to leave my home, the consistency of the Daily Derja has declined, but I’m still trying to do it at least a couple times per week.
