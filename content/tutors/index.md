These are the tutors I’d recommend to a friend. Short list, high signal.

I’ll keep adding to this over time, but I’d rather publish a useful shortlist now than wait for “perfect.”

## Quick Advice Before You Book

- Do 1–2 trial lessons, not 10.
- Tell the tutor exactly what you want: “dialect + correction + small homework.”
- If they don’t correct you, move on.

## Tunisian Dialect (Derja)

### [Arij C.](https://preply.in/ARIJ3EN2460644610?ts=17695271)

Arij is my #1 Tunisian tutor pick. She’s encouraging, organized, and very responsive to feedback. Sessions feel structured without feeling stiff — and I leave remembering things.
